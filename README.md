The AppleScript uses an HTTP transfer code to communicate with the cryptocurrency website and call the current trading price of various coins. It then writes the values to an Excel file to collect historical data. The Excel file provided has some example values collected over a time period and there are some graphical representations of the data provided along with the values.

This project is officially deprecated. The host site actively changed their code during my attempts to establish a connection and collect historical data and I care so little about crypto that I see no point in trying to keep up with the fight for a leading GHG emitting investment option. The code and data herein is free to use for others interested in this topic.
